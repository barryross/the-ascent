Note: 

I do notice the layout of the menu is a bit wonky on Safari and FF (in that takes up too much space).  Assuming you guys like the overall width of the sub-menus, I can work on tweaking the layout so it doesn't take up as much space.

HTML: Although I've added a `<head>` for testing purposes, the markup contained in the `<body>` should be sufficient to use the menu.  
JS: jQuery is already loaded on the site, so I am making use of it.
CSS: The new styles begin at line 397  


Drop-down navigation. Prior to contract completion, I will:

1) Swap absolute URLs to relative, such as `//www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/`
